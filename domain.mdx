## What is a Domain?

A domain is an email domain (like `company.com`) that you've verified ownership of and connected to AI Inbx. Once verified, it becomes your email infrastructure for both sending and receiving.

## What Domains Do

### Sending & Receiving
- **Send from any address**: `hello@yourdomain.com`, `support@yourdomain.com`, etc.
- **Receive at any address**: After connection, your domain automatically collects all inbound emails
- **No setup per address**: Any email address within your domain works immediately

## Domain Setup

1. **Configure DNS**: Add verification and MX records to prove domain ownership and route emails through AI Inbx
2. **Start communicating**: Send and receive emails from any address on your domain
