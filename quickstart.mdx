Get your AI Inbx integration running in minutes. This guide walks you through creating your account, verifying a domain, and sending your first email.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up and create your organization">
    Visit [aiinbx.com](https://aiinbx.com) to create your account and spin up your first organization. This is where you'll manage domains, API keys, and webhooks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your domain">
    Before you can send or receive emails, you need to connect a domain you own. Head to [Domains](https://aiinbx.com/start/domains) in your dashboard, add your domain, and follow the DNS instructions to verify ownership.

    <Note>
      You can only send emails from verified domains. Make sure to complete the DNS verification process.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Navigate to [API Keys](https://aiinbx.com/start/api-keys) in your dashboard and create a new API key. Keep this secure - you'll use it to authenticate all API requests.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send your first email">
    Now you're ready to send your first email! Here's a simple example using curl:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://aiinbx.com/api/v1/emails/send" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "to": "recipient@example.com",
        "from": "hello@yourdomain.com",
        "subject": "Hello from AI Inbx!",
        "html": "<p>This is my first email sent through AI Inbx.</p>"
      }'
    ```

    You'll receive a response with your email ID, thread ID, and message ID:

    ```json
    {
      "emailId": "email_abc123",
      "threadId": "thread_xyz789",
      "messageId": "<message@aiinbx.com>"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore your dashboard">
    Check out your [Threads](https://aiinbx.com/start/threads) to see your conversations, monitor [Metrics](https://aiinbx.com/start/metrics), and configure [Webhooks](https://aiinbx.com/start/webhooks) for real-time **incoming-email** notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next?

Now that you've sent (and can receive) emails, you can:

- **Explore the API**: Open the [API Reference](https://aiinbx.vercel.app/api/openapi-docs) for every endpoint and example
- **Set up webhooks**: Get notified the moment a new email arrives in one of your threads (webhooks currently fire **only for incoming messages**)
- **Manage conversations**: Let our smart threading keep everything tidy while we store your emails for easy retrieval
