title: Webhooks Handling
description: Receive real-time notifications when new emails arrive in AI Inbx.
---

Webhooks let your application **react the moment something happens in AI Inbx**. Currently we fire a webhook whenever a new inbound email is stored:

- `inbound.email.received`

> **Good to know**
> • Webhooks are delivered at-least-once. Make your handler idempotent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an HTTPS endpoint">
    Your server just needs to accept **POST** requests with a JSON body. The example below uses **Next.js App Router** but any framework works – Flask, FastAPI, Express, Cloudflare Workers, …
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the webhook in your dashboard">
    1. Go to [Webhooks](https://aiinbx.com/start/webhooks) <br/>
    2. Click <kbd>New Webhook</kbd> → enter the public URL of your endpoint <br/>
    3. *(Optional but recommended)* Enable **secret** signing – we’ll display a random secret once. Copy it somewhere safe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify every request (recommended)">
    When a secret is enabled we attach two headers:

    - `X-AiInbx-Timestamp` – integer seconds since Unix epoch
    - `X-AiInbx-Signature` – `sha256=` followed by an **HMAC-SHA256** signature calculated over `timestamp.body`

    ```ts title="Verify signature (generic Node.js)"
    import crypto from 'node:crypto'
    import type { IncomingMessage } from 'http'

    const isValidAiInbxSignature = (
      req: IncomingMessage,
      secret: string,
      rawBody: string
    ): boolean => {
      const timestamp = req.headers['x-aiinbx-timestamp'] as string | undefined
      const signature = req.headers['x-aiinbx-signature'] as string | undefined
      if (!timestamp || !signature) return false

      const expected =
        'sha256=' +
        crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(`${timestamp}.${rawBody}`).digest('hex')

      return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
        Buffer.from(signature, 'utf8'),
        Buffer.from(expected, 'utf8')
      )
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage existing webhooks">
    Your list of webhooks lives under [Webhooks](https://aiinbx.com/start/webhooks). From here you can:

    - **Pause** deliveries temporarily and **resume** them later – useful while doing maintenance on your endpoint.
    - **Rotate the secret** with a single click if you suspect it has leaked. We immediately stop using the old secret and display the new one once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Next.js App Router (Typescript)

```ts title="app/api/ai-inbx-webhook/route.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import crypto from 'node:crypto'

type WebhookPayload = {
  event: 'inbound.email.received'
  data: {
    email: unknown
    organization: {
      id: string
      slug: string
    }
  }
  attempt: number
  timestamp: number
}

const AI_INBX_SECRET = process.env.AI_INBX_SECRET!

const verifySignature = (
  request: NextRequest,
  rawBody: string
): boolean => {
  const timestamp = request.headers.get('x-aiinbx-timestamp') || ''
  const signature = request.headers.get('x-aiinbx-signature') || ''

  const expected =
    'sha256=' +
    crypto.createHmac('sha256', AI_INBX_SECRET).update(`${timestamp}.${rawBody}`).digest('hex')

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  )
}

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const rawBody = await request.text()

  // ✅ Reject if the signature is invalid
  if (!verifySignature(request, rawBody)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody) as WebhookPayload
  const {
    data: { email },
    attempt,
    timestamp,
  } = payload

  // TODO: your business logic – store email, trigger agent, …
  console.log('Received email', { email, attempt, timestamp })

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true })
}
```

### Payload structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | string | Always `inbound.email.received` for now |
| `data.email` | object | The full email record (see `GET /emails/{id}` in the API reference) |
| `data.organization` | object | Organization context – helpful if you operate multiple orgs |
| `attempt` | number | Delivery attempt (starts at `1`, increments on retries) |
| `timestamp` | number | Unix epoch seconds of when we sent the webhook |

<ResponseExample name="Sample payload">
```json
{
  "event": "inbound.email.received",
  "data": {
    "email": {...},
    "organization": {
      "id": "org_123",
      "slug": "my-agent"
    }
  },
  "attempt": 1,
  "timestamp": 1715100000
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### Failure handling & auto-pause

We attempt to deliver each event **once**. A non-2xx response or a timeout after **30 seconds** counts as a failure.

AI Inbx tracks `consecutiveFailures` for every webhook:

1. `attempt` in the payload equals `consecutiveFailures + 1` – useful for debugging.
2. After **3** consecutive failures the webhook is automatically **paused** (`isActive = false`).
3. Paused webhooks stop receiving events until you resume them in the dashboard.

Because we don’t retry the same event internally, make sure your endpoint is highly available or enqueue the payload on your side if you need guaranteed processing.
