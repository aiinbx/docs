## What is a Thread?

A **Thread** represents a conversation consisting of related emails. Threads automatically organize emails into logical conversations for easy tracking and management using smart AI algorithms that go beyond simple reply detection to create intelligent threading.

## How Threads Work

### Smart Organization
- **Automatic grouping**: Related emails are automatically organized into conversations
- **AI-powered detection**: Groups emails even when they don't have traditional reply headers
- **Cross-company threading**: Handles when different people from the same company continue conversations
- **Context preservation**: Maintains full conversation history and context
