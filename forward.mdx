title: "Forward a Thread"
description: "Send a full conversation transcript to someone outside the thread"

Forwarding lets you share an entire conversation as a readable transcript with anyone â€” perfect for escalating to a teammate, looping in a vendor, or handing off to a human.

## What forwarding does

- **Includes full context**: We compile the thread into a clean transcript so the recipient sees the whole story.
- **Keeps attachments attached**: Files are forwarded as attachments by default.
- **Optional note**: Add a short note at the top for extra context.

## API Reference

For programmatic forwarding, see the [Forward Thread API endpoint](/api-reference/threads/forward-a-thread-to-email).
